Project overview

This goal of the game is to memorise the colour sequence that is displayed and repeat it. If you are successful, you will move on to the next round with a longer sequence. There are three colours that can be displayed. The three buttons on the Maker Pi Pico are bound each colour, use them to type your answer. After every round, a green or red indicator will pop up to indicate if you are correct or not. Try to last as long as you can.

Setup

This project is written in MicroPython so you will need to have that installed and also an IDE to write the program in. Then, clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/MartynChong/Pico-LED-Memory-Game.git to get the skeleton code to start with. Here is the link to the repository as well, and there is also a solution branch should you need to look at it.
